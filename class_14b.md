What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team.

overall I thought this was a pretty good read and provided a bit of insight on what it takes to create a cohesive successful team. If you were to ask me what it takes to create a successful team I would say the team had to be comprised of individuals who are proficient in the different kinds of codes, this aricle and the data collected proves otherwise and that that is just a piece.  respecting members of your team is critical in the success. Allowing individuals to present their ideas and thoughts, being able to read individuals and their body languge, how you socialize before and after sessions and most importantly choosing a team lead that actually knows how to lead are all important elements. protecting yourself psychologically is equally if not more important. you have to be mindful that the individual is only as strong as your team and how you tal to and respond to individuals makes all of the difference in the sucess of the team.
