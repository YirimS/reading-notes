# CSS

CSS gives you more control of how the elements appear on the page. It allows you to specify the background of your page, the appearance of paragraphs, specify headings and typeface and how things are displayed. you can use internal CSS or external CSS. An internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page. An external stylesheet is a standalone CSS file that is linked from a web page. The advantage of external stylesheets is that it can be created once and the rules applied to multiple web pages.
