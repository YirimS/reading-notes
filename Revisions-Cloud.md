# Revisions and the Cloud

## In this note we will be discussing revisions in the cloud and how it works.

### *We'll also be covering:*
- What is Git?

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. 

- What is Terminal?

Terminal is a command line system that can help you quickly take control of your operating system and make changes. 

- What is VS Code?

VS Code means Visual Studio Code.  VS Code is a code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.

<p> Revisions can be made in both GitHub and in VS Code, though, it is recommended that you use VS Code when working on your pages. Using Terminal and a series of commands you can pull your notes from gitHub and launch them in VS Code. Once you have opened cloned your repositories in Terminal, all of your work, edits and revisions can be made in Vs Code and the edits will reflect in your Notes. You can save preview your changes In VS Code. once you have completed your changes and are happy with your work you can begin the A.C.P (ADD, COMMIT, PULL) flow in terminal and make the changes live on your site. by clicking the link to your URL you can now see the newly rendererd web page and the changes made. <p>

<p> In order for your site to go live you'll want to make sure you have went through the A.C.P Flow in Terminal otherwise your site will not be rendered into a live site with the new changes and revisions. it helps to keep a checklist of the process and check them off as they are completed (example below)<p>


- [x] Add
- [ ] Commit
- [ ] Push

<p> Now that you have some basic understanding of GitHub,Terminal, and VS Code and how they work together, go through this process and see what the results you get. <p>
