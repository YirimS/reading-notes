# How computers work.

Computer execute four basic funtions.
- Take Imput 
- store it as Data
- process information (change it)
- outputs the results (depending on programming)

It uses Bianary data, which only has two digits that are represented by using 1's and 0's. Any Number can be represented using 1's and 0's.

input goes into the computer where it's stored and and then processes into binary code, then output through yoor devices. these devices include, cellphone, tablets, apps, etc.

My top 3 reads were:

- learning Terminal and hown to use that that to acess files on my computer.

- leraning mardowns in gitHub.  how to create repositories and how to use the proper Syntax

- wireframing and why it is important to sketch out your web layout in advance.
