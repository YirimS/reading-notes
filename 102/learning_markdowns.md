# Learning Markdowns

## In this note we will be exploring Markdowns and how they work.

## **What is a Markdown?**

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

<p>Below you'll find some exmples of Syntax Markdowns.</p>

<p>You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.</P>

- Bulleted 
- List

<p>To order your list, precede each line with a number.</P>

1. Numbered
2. List

<p>You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.</p>

1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item

<p> To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].</P>

- [x] crack brown eggs
- [ ] add 2 cups sugar to the eggs
- [ ] mix in 2 cups of flour.


 <P> Now it's your turn. Open up VS Code and try creating a markdown using different syntax.</P>
